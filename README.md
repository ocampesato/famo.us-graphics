This repository contains an assortment of code samples that illustrate how to create graphics and animation effects using the famo.us APIs.

This swatch-like collection contains many code samples that contain minor variations of colors or shapes, and they are included in this project for your convenience.

The initial intent was to create SVG-based code samples as well as CSS3-related code samples, which accounts for the slightly misleading directory names in this repository.

The top-level code samples in this repository use PNG files that are based on the SVG graphics in the following project:
https://github.com/ocampesato/svg-graphics
https://code.google.com/p/svg-graphics/

The code samples in the subdirectories are based on various polar equations, such as Archimedean spirals, Cissoids, Cochleoids, Conchoids, Lissajous curves, and Lituus curves. 

Additional graphics code samples involving CSS3, HTML5 Canvas, D3, and jQuery/CSS3 are here:
